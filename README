This script requires Perl and Games::Dice. Information on installing them can be found here:
http://dotclue.org/t20/
You'll also find that software useful for plotting maps when you've finished.

To apply the collapse/recovery rules from Stellar Reaches 5 you'll need a subsector data file
in .sec format and a text file detailing what sort of environment each subsector should have.
The format is as in the included subsectclass.txt file, thus:

S - Safe.
F - Frontier.
W - Wilds.
D - Deep wilds.
H - Holocaust.

Run the script thus:

./fourhorsemen.pl sector_data.sec subsectclass.txt

This will produce output files called new_sector_data.sec and notes_sector_data.sec. The former
is the altered sector data, and the latter a summary of what the script has been up to whilst running.
This may be of use as a starting point for creating a history for the world since 1130.

The one thing that I have not included is the modifiers to the roll for recovering population through
recolonisation, basically because I was too lazy to add the extra complexity to the code. Therefore,
the referee will have to check the notes file for worlds that have been recolonised and check that there
are sufficient TL9+ worlds in the vicinity for this to happen. The notes files saves the original roll
used to determine if the world was recolonised so that you may check. The original rules can be found
here:

The legal terms for the original rules are here:

This code is made available under the same terms as Perl itself.
